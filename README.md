# 02: Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This repository contains the second challenge for the full stack bootcamp course.

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a portfolio webpage that I can add to and improve upon as the bootcamp progresses.

As a web developer, I want to have a portfolio that showcases my work and is easy for potential employers to access and navigate. With this in mind, I want the webpage to be responsive to most tablet and mobile screen sizes while also doing a good job of showcasing my technical and creative skills.
